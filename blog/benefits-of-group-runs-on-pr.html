                    Running alone can get you to a certain point. But when you're chasing a personal record, running with a group changes everything.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Pace Discipline</h2>
                <p>
                    Running alone, it's easy to settle into whatever pace feels comfortable. You might think you're pushing, but you're actually holding back. Running with people at your target pace shows you what you're actually capable of. You learn to hold a pace you thought was too fast. You learn you can go longer than you thought.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Consistency Over Perfection</h2>
                <p>
                    The fastest way to get faster isn't the perfect training plan. It's showing up consistently. Group runs remove the decision fatigue. The time is set. The people are waiting. You just show up. PRs follow consistency, not perfection.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Push Yourself Further</h2>
                <p>
                    Running alone, you can convince yourself that 3 miles is enough. Running with people at your pace, you push that last mile because they're doing it too. The effort feels shared. The hard parts feel easier when someone else is breathing just as hard next to you.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Accountability That Works</h2>
                <p>
                    When you're supposed to show up at 6am and three other people are waiting for you, you don't hit snooze. You get up. Running alone means only you know if you skip. Running with a crew means skipping isn't invisible anymore.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>
                    Training plans don't show up with you. Motivation fades. Running alone gets boring fast. But people don't. When you run with people who expect you, PRs happen. Not from the perfect plan. From showing up, week after week, with people who expect you.
