## ⚠️ Issues & Concerns

### 1. **Duplicate Privacy Policy Files** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Issue**: Two privacy files exist:
  - `privacy.html` (referenced in about.html)
  - `privacy-policy.html` (referenced in index.html and vite.config.js)
- **Problem**: Inconsistent links, potential confusion
- **Impact**: Broken links, SEO issues, user confusion
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Choose one canonical version (suggest `privacy-policy.html` for SEO)
  - Delete the duplicate
  - Update all references consistently

### 2. **Outdated Content References** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Current**: Links to "demo platform" in package.json description
- **Should Be**: Updated to reflect production launch
- **Location**: `package.json` line 4

### 3. **Vite Configuration Issues** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Issue**: `vite.config.js` only includes `privacy-policy.html` in build, but `about.html` also exists
- **Impact**: `about.html` might not be included in build output
- **Recommendation**: Add `about.html` to rollupOptions.input

### 4. **Missing Meta Tags** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- No Open Graph tags for social sharing
- No Twitter Card tags
- Limited SEO metadata
- **Recommendation**: Add comprehensive meta tags for better social sharing and SEO

### 5. **Inconsistent Navigation** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- `privacy-policy.html` uses `/index.html` (absolute path)
- `privacy.html` uses `index.html` (relative path)
- `about.html` uses `index.html` (relative path)
- **Recommendation**: Standardize to relative paths or root paths consistently

### 6. **Limited Feature Showcase** 🟢 LOW PRIORITY
- Landing page mentions basic features but doesn't highlight:
  - Garmin integration (major feature)
  - RunCrew capabilities (core feature)
  - Training plans (if applicable)
  - Real-time activity tracking
- **Consideration**: May want to expand feature section for launch

### 7. **No App Store Links** 🟢 LOW PRIORITY
- If mobile apps exist or are planned, no download links
- **Future Consideration**: Add when mobile apps are available

### 8. **Contact Information** 🟢 LOW PRIORITY
- Only email in About page
- No social media links (if applicable)
- No support/help center link
- **Consideration**: Add if relevant for launch
