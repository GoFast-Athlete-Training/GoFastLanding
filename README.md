# GoFast Landing Page

## What is this?

This is the **static HTML landing page** for GoFast. It's a simple marketing site that sits at the root domain and directs users to the main platform.

## Structure

- **`index.html`** - Main landing page (the one people see when they visit the site)
- **`src/pages/`** - Additional pages (if needed)

## Purpose

The landing page:
1. Explains what GoFast is
2. Highlights key features
3. Provides a CTA to go to the actual platform (`gofastfrontend-demo.vercel.app`)

## Deployment

Deployed to Vercel at: `gofastcrushgoals.com`

## Tech Stack

- Static HTML
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- No build process needed

## Notes

- This is NOT the main app - that's in `gofastfrontend-demo`
- Keep it simple - just a marketing landing page
- Should be fast, minimal, and convert visitors to users
