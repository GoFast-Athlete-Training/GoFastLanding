# GoFast Landing Page

## What is this?

This is the **static HTML landing page** for GoFast. It's a simple marketing site that sits at the root domain and directs users to the RunCrew platform.

## Structure

- **`index.html`** - Main landing page (the one people see when they visit the site)
- **`benefits.html`** - Benefits of running in groups
- **`how-it-works.html`** - How to find and join a RunCrew
- **`about.html`** - About GoFast
- **`privacy-policy.html`** - Privacy Policy

## Purpose

The landing page:
1. Answers "Why should I click Join a Run Crew?"
2. Highlights benefits of running in groups
3. Explains how to find your crew (searchability feature)
4. Provides a CTA to go to the RunCrew platform (`runcrew.gofastcrushgoals.com`)

## Deployment

Deployed to Vercel at: `gofastcrushgoals.com`

## Tech Stack

- Static HTML
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Vite for building

## Notes

- This is NOT the main app - that's in `gofastapp-mvp`
- Keep it simple - just a marketing landing page focused on RunCrews
- Should be fast, minimal, and convert visitors to users
