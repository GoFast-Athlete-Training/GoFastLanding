        <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-12 text-center">Why Run With a Group?</h1>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Accountability That Actually Works</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    When you're supposed to show up at 6am and three other people are waiting for you, you don't hit snooze. You get up. Running alone means only you know if you skip. Running with a crew means skipping isn't invisible anymore.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Consistency Builds Speed</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    The fastest way to get faster isn't the perfect training plan. It's showing up consistently. Group runs remove the decision fatigue. The time is set. The people are waiting. You just show up. PRs follow consistency, not perfection.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Push Yourself Further</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    Running alone, you can convince yourself that 3 miles is enough. Running with people at your pace, you push that last mile because they're doing it too. The effort feels shared. The hard parts feel easier when someone else is breathing just as hard next to you.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Safety in Numbers</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    Early mornings, late evenings, new routes — running with a group means you're not alone. Whether it's traffic, weather, or just feeling safer in the dark, having people with you removes one more barrier to getting out the door.

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Find Your Actual Pace</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    Running alone, it's easy to settle into whatever pace feels comfortable. Running with people who match your pace shows you what you're actually capable of. You learn to hold a pace you thought was too fast. You learn you can go longer than you thought.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">It Stops Being Boring</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    The same route. The same playlist. The same internal monologue about why you're doing this. Group runs change everything. Conversation. Laughs. Shared suffering that somehow becomes fun. Running stops being a chore and becomes something you look forward to.
